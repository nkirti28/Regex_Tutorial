# Regular Expressions Tutorial

Regular Expression, a Regex is a string of text that allows you to create patterns that help match, locate, and manage text.
This tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression, or regex, functions by breaking down each part of the expression and describing what it does.
A Regex is a sequence of characters that defines a specific search pattern. When included in code or search algorithms, regular expressions can be used to find certain patterns of characters within a string, or to find and replace a character or sequence of characters within a string. 
They are also used frequently to validate input data.


## Summary

Thi Tutorial is covering and breaking down the components of the regular expression patterns used in the following example below to match hex values within a string to validate input data. This pattern is designed for color using the hexadecimal code format for color. In the web applications we can use hex triplets or RGB triplets to represent the colors on the web page. For the hex color code, there are two formats, a standard hex triplet and shorthand hex format, both formats start with a leading number sign #.

1.1 Hex Triplet Format
The hex triplet or standard hex color code uses six (hexadecimal)-digit form to represent color. For examples:

#000000
#FFFFFF
#808080
#8A2BE2
